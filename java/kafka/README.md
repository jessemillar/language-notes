## Kafka Streams
- A stream is "an unbounded, continuous real-time flow of records"
	- Records/messages are key-value pairs
- Kafka stream processing is meant to be part of your application (it's not a separate deployable)
	- Which is good because it doesn't mandate that you change your deployment strategy
- Kafka is meant to help you build a scaling, elastic, distributed system
